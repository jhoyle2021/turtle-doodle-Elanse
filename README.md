Turtle-Doodle
=============

Art Project with Turtles

Here you will create your own drawing using the `turtle` module
from the Python Standard Library. Your drawing should include *multiple
colors, loops, and functions*. You may wish to abstract your functions
in a module, then import it into your main program.

This project is an assessment of your learning of loops, functions,
modules, and abstraction.  Write your program in such a way as to demonstrate
your knowledge of these concepts.  And have fun! Include comments where they
would be helpful to you or the reader. Modify this `README.md` file to
provide instructions for running your code and a short description of your
final product.

Be sure to run the files in `examples/` and make sure you review the grading
rubrics for projects.
